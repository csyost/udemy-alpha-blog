# README

My first Rails app! Built on Rails 6 using Bootstrap, the project got me familiar with many common Rails paradigms including user authentication, database migrations, routing, html embedding, byebug debugging and so on. Uses a SQLite database for local development and Postgres for the Heroku environment.
